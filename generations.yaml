    description: "The BMW E92 is the coupe variant of the fifth-generation 3 Series, distinguished from its E90 sedan counterpart by unique styling elements including a more aggressive front fascia, distinctive roofline, and model-specific interior details. The E92 featured a stiffer chassis than the sedan, with every body panel except the doors being unique to the coupe. Engine options ranged from efficient four-cylinder diesels to powerful six-cylinder petrol units, with the twin-turbocharged 335i producing 306 HP and the naturally aspirated 330i/328i offering refined performance. The range-topping M3 variant featured a high-revving 4.0L V8 engine producing 414 HP, representing the only V8-powered 3 Series coupe in the model's history. Transmission options included six-speed manual and automatic gearboxes, with later models receiving a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) option for the M3. A facelift in 2010 updated the styling and introduced new engine options including the single-turbo N55 replacing the twin-turbo N54 in the 335i. The E92 was the last 3 Series coupe, as its successor would be renamed the 4 Series. The E92 is particularly appreciated by enthusiasts for its combination of engaging driving dynamics, distinctive styling, and the availability of naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions across much of the range."
